// ADVANCED CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

// Enables code for debugging purposes. Not for general use and always in constant flux.
// #define DEBUG // Uncomment to enable. Default disabled.

// Configure rapid and feed override settings. These values define the max and min
// allowable override values and the coarse and fine increments per command received. Please
// note the allowable values in the descriptions following each define.
#define DEFAULT_FEED_OVERRIDE           100 // 100%. Don't change this value.

#define RAPID_OVERRIDE_LOW       25 // Percent of rapid (1-99). Usually 25%.

// When a M2 or M30 program end command is executed, most g-code states are restored to their defaults.
// This compile-time option includes the restoring of the feed and rapi override values
// to their default values at program end.
#define RESTORE_OVERRIDES_AFTER_PROGRAM_END // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// The status report change for Grbl v1.1 and after also removed the ability to disable/enable most data
// fields from the report. This caused issues for GUI developers, who've had to manage several scenarios
// and configurations. The increased efficiency of the new reporting style allows for all data fields to
// be sent without potential performance issues.
// NOTE: The options below are here only provide a way to disable certain data fields if a unique
// situation demands it, but be aware GUIs may depend on this data. If disabled, it may not be compatible.
#define REPORT_FIELD_BUFFER_STATE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_PIN_STATE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_CURRENT_FEED_SPEED // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_OVERRIDES // Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define REPORT_FIELD_LINE_NUMBERS // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Some status report data isn't necessary for realtime, only intermittently, because the values don't
// change often. The following macros configures how many times a status report needs to be called before
// the associated data is refreshed and included in the status report. However, if one of these value
// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.
// NOTE: WCO refresh must be 2 or greater. OVR refresh must be 1 or greater.
#define REPORT_OVR_REFRESH_BUSY_COUNT 20  // (1-255)

#define REPORT_WCO_REFRESH_IDLE_COUNT 10  // (2-255) Must be less than or equal to the busy count

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother
// acceleration, particularly noticeable on machines that run at very high feedrates, but may negatively
// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.
#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 100

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error
// check in the settings module to prevent settings values that will exceed this limitation. The maximum
// step rate is strictly limited by the CPU speed and will change if something other than an AVR running
// at 16MHz is used.
// NOTE: For now disabled, will enable if flash space permits.
// #define MAX_STEP_RATE_HZ 30000 // Hz

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased
// to help minimize transmission waiting within the serial write protocol.
// #define REPORT_ECHO_LINE_RECEIVED // Default disabled. Uncomment to enable.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always
// zero. This value controls how fast the machine moves through junctions with no regard for acceleration
// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, i.e. 3d printers or laser cutters. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0 // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.
#define MINIMUM_FEED_RATE 1.0 // (mm/min)

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction with expensive sin() and cos() calcualtions. This parameter maybe decreased if there
// are issues with the accuracy of the arc generations, or increased if arc execution is getting
// bogged down by too many trig calculations.
#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 12 // Integer (1-255)

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
#define ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON 5E-7 // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// Creates a delay between the direction pin setting and corresponding step pulse by creating
// another interrupt (Timer2 compare) to manage it. The main Grbl interrupt (Timer1 compare)
// sets the direction pins, and does not immediately set the stepper pins, as it would in
// normal operation. The Timer2 compare fires next to set the stepper pins after the step
// pulse delay time, and Timer2 overflow will complete the step pulse, except now delayed
// by the step pulse time plus the step pulse delay. (Thanks langwadt for the idea!)
// NOTE: Uncomment to enable. The recommended delay must be > 3us, and, when added with the
// user-supplied step pulse time, the total time must not exceed 127us. Reported successful
// values for certain setups have ranged from 5 to 20us.
// #define STEP_PULSE_DELAY 10 // Step pulse delay in microseconds. Default disabled.

// The number of linear motions in the planner buffer to be planned at any give time. The vast
// majority of RAM that Grbl uses is based on this buffer size. Only increase if there is extra
// available RAM, like when re-compiling for a Mega2560. Or decrease if the Arduino begins to
// crash due to the lack of available RAM or if the CPU is having trouble keeping up with planning
// new incoming motions as they are executed.
// #define BLOCK_BUFFER_SIZE 16 // Uncomment to override default in planner.h.

// Governs the size of the intermediary step segment buffer between the step execution algorithm
// and the planner blocks. Each segment is set of steps executed at a constant velocity over a
// fixed time defined by ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND. They are computed such that the planner
// block velocity profile is traced exactly. The size of this buffer governs how much step
// execution lead time there is for other Grbl processes have to compute and do their thing
// before having to come back and refill this buffer, currently at ~50msec of step moves.
// #define SEGMENT_BUFFER_SIZE 6 // Uncomment to override default in stepper.h.

// Line buffer size from the serial input stream to be executed. Also, governs the size of
// each of the startup blocks, as they are each stored as a string of this size. Make sure
// to account for the available EEPROM at the defined memory address in settings.h and for
// the number of desired startup blocks.
// NOTE: 80 characters is not a problem except for extreme cases, but the line buffer size
// can be too small and g-code blocks can get truncated. Officially, the g-code standards
// support up to 256 characters. In future versions, this default will be increased, when
// we know how much extra memory space we can re-invest into this.
// #define LINE_BUFFER_SIZE 80  // Uncomment to override default in protocol.h

// Serial send and receive buffer size. The receive buffer is often used as another streaming
// buffer to store incoming blocks to be processed by Grbl when its ready. Most streaming
// interfaces will character count and track each block send to each block response. So,
// increase the receive buffer if a deeper receive buffer is needed for streaming and avaiable
// memory allows. The send buffer primarily handles messages in Grbl. Only increase if large
// messages are sent and Grbl begins to stall, waiting to send the rest of the message.
// NOTE: Grbl generates an average status report in about 0.5msec, but the serial TX stream at
// 115200 baud will take 5 msec to transmit a typical 55 character report. Worst case reports are
// around 90-100 characters. As long as the serial TX buffer doesn't get continually maxed, Grbl
// will continue operating efficiently. Size the TX buffer around the size of a worst-case report.
// #define RX_BUFFER_SIZE 128 // (1-254) Uncomment to override defaults in serial.h
// #define TX_BUFFER_SIZE 100 // (1-254)

// Enable the '$RST=*', '$RST=$', and '$RST=#' eeprom restore commands. There are cases where
// these commands may be undesirable. Simply comment the desired macro to disable it.
// NOTE: See SETTINGS_RESTORE_ALL macro for customizing the `$RST=*` command.
#define ENABLE_RESTORE_EEPROM_WIPE_ALL         // '$RST=*' Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define ENABLE_RESTORE_EEPROM_DEFAULT_SETTINGS // '$RST=$' Default enabled. Comment to disable.
#define ENABLE_RESTORE_EEPROM_CLEAR_PARAMETERS // '$RST=#' Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Defines the EEPROM data restored upon a settings version change and `$RST=*` command. Whenever the
// the settings or other EEPROM data structure changes between Grbl versions, Grbl will automatically
// wipe and restore the EEPROM. This macro controls what data is wiped and restored. This is useful
// particularily for OEMs that need to retain certain data. For example, the BUILD_INFO string can be
// written into the Arduino EEPROM via a seperate .INO sketch to contain product data. Altering this
// macro to not restore the build info EEPROM will ensure this data is retained after firmware upgrades.
// NOTE: Uncomment to override defaults in settings.h
// #define SETTINGS_RESTORE_ALL (SETTINGS_RESTORE_DEFAULTS | SETTINGS_RESTORE_PARAMETERS | SETTINGS_RESTORE_STARTUP_LINES | SETTINGS_RESTORE_BUILD_INFO)

// Enable the '$I=(string)' build info write command. If disabled, any existing build info data must
// be placed into EEPROM via external means with a valid checksum value. This macro option is useful
// to prevent this data from being over-written by a user, when used to store OEM product data.
// NOTE: If disabled and to ensure Grbl can never alter the build info line, you'll also need to enable
// the SETTING_RESTORE_ALL macro above and remove SETTINGS_RESTORE_BUILD_INFO from the mask.
// NOTE: See the included grblWrite_BuildInfo.ino example file to write this string seperately.
#define ENABLE_BUILD_INFO_WRITE_COMMAND // '$I=' Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// AVR processors require all interrupts to be disabled during an EEPROM write. This includes both
// the stepper ISRs and serial comm ISRs. In the event of a long EEPROM write, this ISR pause can
// cause active stepping to lose position and serial receive data to be lost. This configuration
// option forces the planner buffer to completely empty whenever the EEPROM is written to prevent
// any chance of lost steps.
// However, this doesn't prevent issues with lost serial RX data during an EEPROM write, especially
// if a GUI is premptively filling up the serial RX buffer simultaneously. It's highly advised for
// GUIs to flag these gcodes (G10,G28.1,G30.1) to always wait for an 'ok' after a block containing
// one of these commands before sending more data to eliminate this issue.
// NOTE: Most EEPROM write commands are implicitly blocked during a job (all '$' commands). However,
// coordinate set g-code commands (G10,G28/30.1) are not, since they are part of an active streaming
// job. At this time, this option only forces a planner buffer sync with these g-code commands.
#define FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_EEPROM_WRITE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// In Grbl v0.9 and prior, there is an old outstanding bug where the `WPos:` work position reported
// may not correlate to what is executing, because `WPos:` is based on the g-code parser state, which
// can be several motions behind. This option forces the planner buffer to empty, sync, and stop
// motion whenever there is a command that alters the work coordinate offsets `G10,G43.1,G92,G54-59`.
// This is the simplest way to ensure `WPos:` is always correct. Fortunately, it's exceedingly rare
// that any of these commands are used need continuous motions through them.
#define FORCE_BUFFER_SYNC_DURING_WCO_CHANGE // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This optional dual axis feature is primarily for the homing cycle to locate two sides of
  a dual-motor gantry independently, i.e. self-squaring. This requires an additional limit
  switch for the cloned motor. To self square, both limit switches on the cloned axis must
  be physically positioned to trigger when the gantry is square. Highly recommend keeping
  the motors always enabled to ensure the gantry stays square with the $1=255 setting.

  For Grbl on the Arduino Uno, the cloned axis limit switch must to be shared with and
  wired with z-axis limit pin due to the lack of available pins. The homing cycle must home
  the z-axis and cloned axis in different cycles, which is already the default config.

  The dual axis feature works by cloning an axis step output onto another pair of step
  and direction pins. The step pulse and direction of the cloned motor can be set
  independently of the main axis motor. However to save precious flash and memory, this
  dual axis feature must share the same settings (step/mm, max speed, acceleration) as the
  parent motor. This is NOT a feature for an independent fourth axis. Only a motor clone.

  WARNING: Make sure to test the directions of your dual axis motors! They must be setup
  to move the same direction BEFORE running your first homing cycle or any long motion!
  Motors moving in opposite directions can cause serious damage to your machine! Use this
  dual axis feature at your own risk.
*/
// NOTE: This feature requires approximately 400 bytes of flash. Certain configurations can
// run out of flash to fit on an Arduino 328p/Uno. Only X and Y axes are supported

// Select the one axis to mirror another motor. Only X and Y axis is supported at this time.
#define DUAL_AXIS_SELECT  X_AXIS  // Must be either X_AXIS or Y_AXIS

// To prevent the homing cycle from racking the dual axis, when one limit triggers before the
// other due to switch failure or noise, the homing cycle will automatically abort if the second
// motor's limit switch does not trigger within the three distance parameters defined below.
// Axis length percent will automatically compute a fail distance as a percentage of the max
// travel of the other non-dual axis, i.e. if dual axis select is X_AXIS at 5.0%, then the fail
// distance will be computed as 5.0% of y-axis max travel. Fail distance max and min are the
// limits of how far or little a valid fail distance is.

// NOTE: Protoneer CNC Shield v3.51 has A.STP and A.DIR wired to pins A4 and A3 respectively.
#define DUAL_AXIS_CONFIG_PROTONEER_V3_51    // Uncomment to select. Comment other configs.

// NOTE: Arduino CNC Shield Clone (Originally Protoneer v3.0) has A.STP and A.DIR wired to

// the spindle enable pin had to be moved and spindle direction pin deleted. The spindle
// enable pin now resides on A3. Spindle enable is used far more and this pin setup helps
// facilitate users to integrate this feature without arguably too much work.
// Variable spindle (i.e. laser mode) does NOT work with this shield as configured. While
// variable spindle technically can work with this shield, it requires too many changes for
// most user setups to accomodate. It would best be implemented by sharing all limit switches
// on pins D9/D10 (as [X1,Z]/[X2,Y] or [X,Y2]/[Y1,Z]), home each axis independently, and
// updating lots of code to ensure everything is running correctly.
